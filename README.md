# Mission Statement

In Canada, buildings account for almost a third of its’ annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As Canadian cities continue to grow, so does the demand for energy. Buildings have a substantial impact on the environment as they use resources, generate waste and are costly to maintain and operate. There is high potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at very little costs, benefiting the environment, economy and society. With new constructions, renovations or retrofits, buildings in Toronto can achieve superior levels of energy efficiency by using fewer resources, reducing waste, improving air quality and eliminating negative environmental impacts. 

Toronto’s population is projected to grow over 35% by 2050, which will further the expansion of residential and commercial infrastructure. In 2010, the City of Toronto implemented the [Toronto Green Standard](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/toronto-green-standard/toronto-green-standard-overview/), which are sustainable design requirements for new private and city-owned developments. This includes a performance target for new buildings to approach zero emissions by 2030. [Toronto’s Climate Action Strategy](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/91f6-TransformTO-Modelling-Torontos-Low-Carbon-Future-Results-of-Modelling-Gr....pdf) also has a city-wide goal of achieving an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. These targets not only reduce carbon emissions but also make Toronto’s buildings more resilient, comfortable and affordable with lower energy costs.
 
Our app, Sustainera, aims to promote sustainable buildings using 2 strategies; reducing energy/water consumption and planting green rooftops. Choosing efficient insulation, lighting and appliances saves energy, lowers utility bills, increases indoor comfort and reduce impacts on the environment. Green roofs act as a rainwater buffer, reduce noise and air pollution, regulate indoor temperatures by providing extra insulation and absorb CO2, making urban areas less likely to become heat islands. Buildings that choose to be more sustainable will face higher initial costs, but the difference will be easily recovered over time through energy savings. Not only do green buildings benefit tenants and households with savings in utilities, but they also lower maintenance costs and increase property value for building developers.
